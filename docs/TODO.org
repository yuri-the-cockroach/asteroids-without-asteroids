#+title: Todo for this project


- [X] Figureout how to work with raylib
- [X] Refactor project into a more modular system

* Movement
- [X] Add motion inertia to the objects, which basically allows for propper physics
- [ ] Figure out a way to limit player acceleration by something like log(n), as he approaches the max speed
  But make it be applied only when his absolute speed is rising and not falling.
  Preferably do it in a way that will not involve logic and only math.

* Physics
- [ ] Make a more generelized physics handler that will apply to all objects.
  Most likely just refactor the code to handle multiple objects with same rules as the player

* Rendering
- [ ] Look into using a 2D camera, so I don't have to limit player movement to the screen size.
- [ ] Look into using sprites

* Gameplay
- [ ] Shooting
  - [ ] Projectile physics and haldeing. Not sure how yet.

- [ ] Asteroids
