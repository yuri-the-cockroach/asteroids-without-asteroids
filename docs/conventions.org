#+title: Conventions
#+description: This file will serve as a guide for the coding conventions I'm using in this project.

* Error handling:
- errno MUST be set to 0 on the program start
- errno will be checked on any somewhat critical function
and will result in the cancellation if errno is not 0.
- errno should ALLWAYS be set to 0 when calling a function.
- If a function needs to set errno for any reason,
  it must be returned back to 0 after the error has been handled
